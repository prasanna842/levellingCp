Here are what I learnt in this project..codes are based on what practised so far
1) Basic C++
2) STL library
3) Time and Space Complexity
4) Basic algoritms of Sorting,Searching
5) Data structures like queues,trees,stacks with their correct usages and implementations
6) Brute Force algoritms
7) Recursions and back tracking
8) Apart From learning these I participatied in codeforces div 3,div 2 contests also ..I am excited to earn more and enjoy contests
9) Dynamic Programming
10) Trees..BFS,DFS
11) Heaps & priority queues

### Submission Overview:
- **Submission 1**: Easy and beginner-level problems, focused on basic logic and implementation.
- **Submission 2**: Medium to hard problems, improving logic and understanding of constraints.
- **Submission 3**: LeetCode problems focused mainly on Dynamic Programming (DP).
- **Submission 4**: A 2-hour contest attempt, included to reflect time-limited coding skills.

My Codeforces rating changed from 100 to 1056 (1106 max).
I'm glad about this progress and will keep solving more great problems.
I enjoy participating in contests and aim to improve my speed and accuracy under pressure.

### Tools & Languages:
