Here are what I learnt in this project..codes are based on what practised so far
1) Basic C++
2) STL library
3) Time and Space Complexity
4) Basic algoritms of Sorting,Searching
5) Data structures like queues,trees,stacks with their correct usages and implementations
6) Brute Force algoritms
7) Recursions and back tracking
8) Apart From learning these I participatied in codeforces div 3,div 2 contests also ..I am excited to earn more and enjoy contests
submission1 has easy and few medium problems,submission2 has medium to hard problems
